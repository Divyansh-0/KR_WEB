When virus-carrying aphids (also called virulifer aphids) feed on a healthy plant, symptoms are usually minor and only appear in tissues that form after infection. The first symptom usually appears in the second leaf as soon as possible after one plant has been infected.

        Symptoms: Dark green leaf on the middle part of the lower part and later on the secondary veins. The primary symptoms of the disease are seen when infected sucking plants are planted. Such infected sucking puttforth narrow leaves, which are chlorotic and exhibit mosaic traits. The affected leaves are rolled upwards from their margins. The characteristic symptom of clustered top virus is the presence of dark green stripes obstructed along the secondary veins of the lamina or the midpoint of the petiole. Diseased plants remain dry and do not produce a bunch of any commercial value.
        
        Organic Solution: Wipe the upper and lower surface of each leaf blade, as well as the stem. Ultra-fine horticultural oil can be used, but it is rarely necessary because physical removal is often quite effective.

Its spores can spread by air, water and insects, as well as by birds and mice fed on bananas. It is the main disease affecting the quality of banana fruits during transportation and storage.

  Symptoms: dark brown/brown on green fruit. Black wounds. These lesions grow on yellow fruits Size, orange fungal growth can be found In the center of the wounds. Symptoms can also be found on the tips. Premature ripening of fruit.
  
  Organic Solution: Actively remove non-crop species from banana plantations to reduce favorable fungal environment. Use of biofungicides during harvest (10% Arabic glue and 1.0% chitosan) to control the fungus during storage. The use of natural plant extracts to reduce fungal growth (citric, ginger rhizome, clodrum extract). Dipping green fruits in warm water reduces the spread of the disease (55 ° C 2 minutes).

        Symptoms: The symptom is yellowing of one or two small leaves. Black spots appear on the leaves of the spindle. The basal tissue of the leaf rots quickly and can be easily separated from the crown. The infection spreads to older leaves, causing sunken leaf spots covering the entire leaf blades. The spot margins are irregular and water-soaked, and when the leaves move in front the specific irregular spots are typical on the blades. In later stages the axle withers and falls down. The soft leaf base and the soft tissue of the crown emit a rotten odor into a disgusting mass of decaying material. Eventually, the whole crown falls down and the palm dies.

In advanced cases, the interior of the affected trunks becomes hollow due to the decay of internal tissues. As a result of extensive damage in the stem tissue, the outer whirl of the leaves is yellow, dry and shed prematurely. The production of clusters is adversely affected. Attention is also paid to nut fall. The trunk slowly taps to the top and in older cases the size of the crown decreases.

    Symptoms: Pink bollworm causes failure to open buds, bold shedding, lint damage and seed loss. In early summer, the first generation of larvae feed in squares, which continue to bloom and grow. The second generation of larvae, in seeds, are buried in seeds, through lint, to feed on seeds.
    
    Organic Solution: Sex pheromones extracted from Pectinophora gossipiella can be sprayed throughout the infected areas. Timely spraying with formulations of spinosad or Bacillus thuringiensis may also be effective.
    
    Chemical Solution: Foliar application of insecticide formulations containing chlorpyrifos, asfenvalrate, or indoxacarb can be used to kill pink mucus mites.
